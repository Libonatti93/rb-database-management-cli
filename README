A Ruby command-line application (CLI) for managing an SQLite database. This application will allow you to add, list, update, and delete records in a contacts table. We will use the sqlite3 gem to interact with the database and thor to build the command-line interface.

1. Initial Setup
First, create a directory for the project and set up the environment:
mkdir db_manager
cd db_manager

How to Run the CLI
To run the CLI, you can run the Ruby file with the necessary commands. Here are some examples:

Add a Contact:
ruby db_manager.rb add "Jo√£o Silva" "joao@example.com" "123-456-7890"


List All Contacts:
ruby db_manager.rb list


Update a Contact:
ruby db_manager.rb update 1 "Maria Souza" "maria@example.com" "098-765-4321"


Delete a Contact:
ruby db_manager.rb delete 1



Explanations and Customizations
SQLite Database: The application uses a SQLite database (contacts.db). The contacts table is created automatically if it does not exist.

Thor CLI: Thor makes it easy to create command-line commands with descriptions and arguments. In the code, the add, list, update, and delete methods are defined as CLI commands.

Full CRUD: The example covers the basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
